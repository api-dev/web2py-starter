various small bug fixes

0.3 - March 25, 2016

updated layout UI for new messaging dropdown menu
- displays unread message count
- displays list of unread messages with link to view message
- displays links to view all messages and to create new message
changed messages to use email associated with user
inbound emails lookup user based on email or leave the user associated with the inbound email blank
added ability to reply to messages in the app (in addition to create new messages and receive messages)

Message system still needs:
- ability to associate message to a 'context'
- ability to send and receive attachments

0.2 - March 24, 2016

evaluated Mandrill/Mailchimp, Sendgrid, and Mailgun for transactional email
selected Mailgun and completed signup and initial configuration
added Message table to database
added custom List, Create, View, and Edit pages for Messages
developed outbound API for sending message
developed inbound webhook for receiving messages
added link to the "View All Messages" text in the messages dropdown in the header (the message list and message count that appear on the icon and dropdown menu are still hardcoded)
tested locally using ngrok and deployed to the test server
